                <p> It is the most common type of poultry in the world.
                    Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them 
                    in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have 
                    become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, 
                    and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.</p>

                <p> It is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle.

                    Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat 
                    from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages.

                     tuna or imitation crab meat</p>
